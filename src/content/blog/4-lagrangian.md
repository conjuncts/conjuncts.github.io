This visual proof accompanies [Abide by Reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hp11d1Z-78)'s video which excellently motivates why $\mathcal{L} = K - U$ in Lagrangian mechanics.

### Explanation

P is located (K'O - U'O) along the ℒ axis. (That is, $\overline{PO} = \overline{K'O} - \overline{K'P}$. And $\overline{K'P} = \overline{U'O}$ because of the purple dashed line.) But K' and U' are simply the projections of the original K and U onto the ℒ axis. Hence, the extent of P along the ℒ axis is proportional to K - U; that is, ℒ ∝ K - U.
